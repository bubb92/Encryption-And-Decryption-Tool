# Encryption-And-Decryption-Tool
**It's teamwork!**
Data protection can be accomplished by changing the original data by any means to some other to use data so that if someone gets that data then also it must remain in unuseful bits. This process can be achieved by Encrypting that data by some means of algorithms which are known to the sender and the similar Decryption algorithms to be known to only the desired receiver so that it can avert that encrypted data back to the use understandable farm.
